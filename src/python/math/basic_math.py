def prime_factors(n: int) -> list:
    '''Prime Factorization of an integer using sieve.

    The Algorithm:
    First we deal with all the composite numbers in step 1 then prime numbers in step 2.
    1.  Evens by checking n % 2 == 0 and then do n / 2 to reduce n for each 2.
    2. Prime numbers starting from 3 until âˆšn since any 2 numbers > âˆšn, s.t. a * b > n and hence can't be a factor of n.
    In step 2 of the above algorithm, we run a loop and do:
        a) Find the least prime factor i (must be less than âˆšn,)
        b) Remove all occurrences i from n by repeatedly dividing n by i.
        c) Repeat steps a and b for divided n and i += 2. The steps a and b are repeated till n becomes either 1 or a prime number.

    Time Complexity: O(log n)

    Doctest:
    >>> prime_factors(100)
    [2, 2, 5, 5]
    >>> prime_factors(510)
    [2, 3, 5, 17]

def number_of_divisors(n: int) -> int:
    '''Get a list of number of divisors of an integer.

    We use similar technique as to find prime factors.
    We add two variables div & temp and do the following:
    1. For each even factor we find we increment temp & reduce n / 2.
    2. Once completely reduced, we multiply it to div, meaning that as many times as we could reduce n by 2 i.e. as many even divisors exist for n.
    3. Then similar to step 2 of prime_factors we check for prime numbers and do following in loop up to sqrt of remaining n:
        a. We reset temp and for each i (3, âˆšn + 1, 2) while n % i == 0, we reduce n / i and increment temp
        c. Once completely reduced i.e. n = 1, we multiply temp to div, i.e. as many times as you could reduce n / 2, you can achieve n with all the i's * those even divisors.

    Time Complexity: O(log n)
